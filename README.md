# School-Projects
This is just where im going to be keeping my 2021 school projects

The DontReadthis.txt files are just so i can create the folders 

if there isnt a txt file with the code (not the donotreadthing one)
then it doesent need to load anything from a file and it should genertae one in the same directoy its ran in
